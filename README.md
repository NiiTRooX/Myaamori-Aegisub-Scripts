## Merge Scripts

### Overview

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_overview.png)

Merge Scripts is an advanced bidirectional script merger.
It allows you to define a set of imports in an ASS file, which can then be used to import and unimport other files, as well as export any changes to the original files.
This is particularly useful when you are using a VCS such as git to store your files in a modular layout, where e.g. dialogue, songs and typesetting are stored in separate files and where the filenames don't change.
In such a scenario, you only need to define the imports once, after which all scripts can be re-merged in a single click anytime something is changed.
No more manually having to merge and shift songs every time you change something in the OP!
The ability to export changes also means that the modular structure can be kept, while still allowing for e.g. easy QC from a single file.

### Importing files

To import files you must first create an import definition.
Merge Scripts can do this for you using the **Add file to include** option.
Simply select the file or files that you wish to include, and import definitions will be added for you at the end of the file.

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_importdef.png)

This script contains import definitions for three files: `shoujo kageki 03.ass`, `insert 03.ass`, and `signs 03.ass`.
In order to actually import the files, we use the **Import all external files** option.
This will read the files specified in the import definitions and add their styles and dialogue lines to the current script.

You can also use **wildcards** to specify groups of files, e.g. `signs*.ass`.
Files imported in this manner will generally be treated as one single large file as far as Merge Scripts is concerned.

![after import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_postimport.png)

Every style will be prefixed with an identifier to keep track of what file the line came from.
Files can be imported selectively using **Import selected external file(s)**, which will only import files corresponding to the currently selected import definitions.

Once files have been imported, they can be unimported to get back the original file prior to importing using the **Remove all external files** option.
This will delete all lines that belong to imported files.
Much like with importing, you can remove files selectively using **Remove selected external file(s)**, which will only remove the file corresponding to the currently selected files (you may select either the import definition or any line from the file you wish to remove).

![import gui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_importgui.png)

In order to make selective importing and unimporting easier, there's also a GUI available through the **Select files to import or unimport** option.
It will detect all defined imports and ask which of the files you wish to import.
If you deselect an already imported file, it will be unimported.

### Exporting changes

The **Export changes** option allows you to export any changes you've made to the lines to their original files.
You will get a warning showing what files will be overwritten upon export.
Note that the script will currently *not* export script properties, but will leave the Script Info and Aegisub Project Garbage sections as they were in the source file.
Export changes will keep any extradata generated by automations intact.

### Shifted imports

![shifted import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_shiftedimport.png)

Shifted imports automatically shift the lines in the imported file so that the start time of a synchronization line in the external file matches the start time of the import definition.
Run **Add synchronization line for shifted imports** on the file to import to add a new synchronization line at the current video time, and **Add file to include (shifted)** to add a shifted import definition at the current video time.

When exporting changes to a shifted file, the timings will be shifted back to match the original position of the synchronization line.
This means that shifting the lines will not affect the timing in the source file, however relative adjustments to individual lines such as fixed scene bleeds will be exported.

### Conflicting script properties on import

![conflicting properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/master/assets/ms_conflict.png)

When importing files, Merge Scripts will set script properties such as the resolution of the current script to match the imported files.
However, if there are conflicting values among the imported scripts, Merge Scripts will warn about this and let you choose which value to use.
If you hover over the dropdown box you can see the corresponding value from each individual file.
Note that **Merge Scripts will not attempt to resample the lines based on your selection**.
Thus, in the event of a conflict it is usually best to correct the offending file first.

### Generating a release version

Since you may not want to release the script publicly with all styles prefixed and the import definitions included (not that it would affect the viewing experience in any way), Merge Scripts also provides the **Generate release candidate** option.
This will allow you to save a new file with the prefixes from all styles, unused styles, and commented and empty lines removed.
It will also warn about conflicting style names.

### Other misc. features

* If you set the layer field of an import definition line, all lines imported from that file will have their layers incremented by that value.
This is useful for e.g. importing dialogue lines, if you want to ensure that they are automatically layered above typesetting.

## Sub Digest

### Overview

```
subdigest -i script.ass --selection-set style "Default|Alt" --keep-selected --remove-unused-styles --sort-field start ASC
```

Sub Digest is a utility for quick processing of ASS files.
At the basic level it can do e.g. sorting, simple replacement with regex, and modification of values using Python expressions.
However, most of its power comes from the use of *selections*, which make it possible to operate on just a subset of the file.

Sub Digest makes use of [python-ass](https://github.com/chireiden/python-ass), and inherits many of its conventions, including field names.
It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with python-ass first before making use of Sub Digest.

```

### Installation

Install Sub Digest with pip:

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/#subdirectory=scripts/sub-digest
```

This will add a `subdigest` executable along with the `subdigest.py` Python module.
If the executable is not in your path, you can run Sub Digest as `python -m subdigest --help`, or alternatively `py -3 -m subdigest --help` on Windows.

### Workflow

The arguments to Sub Digest are processed as consecutive commands, with the output of one command being fed as the input to the next.
If you run e.g. `--sort-field start ASC --sort-field style ASC`, it will first sort by start time and then by style name.

By default Sub Digests works on the events section of the file, which contains the dialogue lines.
You can use the `--use-styles` argument to switch to the styles section instead, so that any following arguments will modify the styles section.
Use `--use-events` to switch back.

### Selections

By default, all lines are treated as selected, meaning that most commands such as `--sort-field` will operate on all lines (in the current section).
If you wish to only operate on a subset of lines, use the `--selection-*` commands.
E.g. `--selection-set style "^Default"` will set the selection to all lines whose style begins with "Default", and `--selection-intersect TYPE "Comment"` will intersect the current selection with all commented lines.
To reset the selection, and thus select all lines again, use `--selection-clear`.
Operations that support selections include `--sort-*`, `--modify-*`, `--keep-selected` and `--remove-selected`.

### Expressions

Some commands have alternative versions that take arbitrary Python expressions.
In these expressions, the current line will be available as `_`.
There are also a number of functions available to make it easier to modify the start and end times of a line, which are represented as `datetime.timedelta` objects, namely: `mins(x)`, `secs(x)`, `millis(x)` and `frames(x)`, which take a float and return a corresponding `timedelta` object.
For `frames(x)`, you can set the framerate to use for calculations using `--fps`, e.g. `--fps 24000/1001`.
For instance, in order to add a lead-in of 100 ms to all lines, you can use `--modify-expr start "_.start - secs(0.1)"`.

### Use from Python (interactive session)

Sub Digest also provides a `subdigest.py` module which can be imported from Python.
This allows for the possibility of interactively editing an ASS file from the Python REPL.

```
$ python
>>> import ass
>>> import subdigest
>>> with open('script.ass') as f:
...   subs = subdigest.Subtitles(ass.parse(f))
...
>>> subs.
subs.get_field(                 subs.move_selection(            subs.selection                  subs.selection_intersect_expr(  subs.sort_expr(
subs.keep_selected(             subs.remove_all_tags(           subs.selection_add(             subs.selection_set(             subs.sort_field(
subs.merge_file(                subs.remove_selected(           subs.selection_add_expr(        subs.selection_set_expr(        subs.sub_file
subs.modify_expr(               subs.remove_unused_styles(      subs.selection_clear(           subs.selection_subtract(        subs.use_events(
subs.modify_field(              subs.section                    subs.selection_intersect(       subs.selection_subtract_expr(   subs.use_styles(
>>> subs.selection_set("style", "^Default")
<subdigest.Subtitles object at 0x7f9ba4d49e48>
>>> subs.modify_field("text", "-chan", "")
<subdigest.Subtitles object at 0x7f9ba4d49e48>
>>> with open('output.ass', 'w') as f:
...   subs.dump_file(f)
```

All `ass.document.Document` properties and methods are available directly from the `subdigest.Subtitles` object, including the `events` and `styles` objects.

Note that at the current point in time most operations are performed in-place, meaning that there is no way to undo a change.

### Examples

Get the text of dialogue lines as plain text, with override tags and comments removed:
```
subdigest -i script.ass --remove-all-tags --get-field text
```

Change all instances of `-chan` and `-san` to `{**-chan}` and `{**-san}`, respectively, for use with [Daiz's Autoswapper](https://github.com/Daiz/AegisubMacros/#autoswapperlua---autoswapper):
```
subdigest -i script.ass --in-place --modify-field text "(-(chan|san))" "{**\1}"
```

Extract only the dialogue lines from a muxed script:
```
subdigest -i script.ass -o dialogue.ass --selection-set style "Default|Alt" --keep-selected --remove-unused-styles --sort-field start ASC
```

Use together with [Prass](https://github.com/tp7/Prass/):
```
subdigest -i script.ass --selection-set style "Default" --keep-selected | prass tpp - --lead-in 100 --lead-out 200 | subdigest --sort-field start ASC
```

Merge files:
```
subdigest -i dialogue.ass --merge-file typesetting.ass --merge-file OP.ass
```

Remove all lines within the first 5 minutes:
```
subdigest -i dialogue.ass --set-selection-expr "_.start < mins(5)" --remove-selected
```

Replace styles with styles from a different ASS file:
```
subdigest -i previous_episode.ass --remove-selected > only_styles.ass # remove dialogue lines
subdigest -i current_episode.ass --use-styles --remove-selected --merge-file only_styles.ass
```

## ASSParser

### Overview

ASSParser is a module containing facilities for parsing ASS files and related utilities written in MoonScript for use with Aegisub automations.

### Usage

```moon
parser = require 'myaa.ASSParser'
file = open 'my script.ass'
parsed_file = parser.parse_file file
file\close!

for event in *parsed_file.events
    aegisub.log "#{event.text}\n"
```

### Documentation

#### parse_file(file)

Parses an ASS file.

Arguments:

* **file**: A file handle to the ASS file to parse

Returns: An `ASSFile` object representing the parsed file, containing the following fields:

* **styles**: A list of style lines.
* **events**: A list of event (dialogue) lines.
* **script_info**: A list of info lines representing the Script Info section.
* **script_info_mapping**: A table mapping Script Info keys to their corresponding values.
* **aegisub_garbage**: A list of info lines representing the Aegisub Project Garbage section.
* **aegisub_garbage_mapping**: A table mapping Aegisub Project Garbage keys to their corresponding values.
* **extradata**: A table mapping numerical extradata IDs to data lines (see below).
* **extradata_mapping**: A table mapping keys and values to their original ID.
`extradata_mapping[key][value]` is the numerical ID of the extradata line with key `key` and value `value`.

The style, dialogue and info lines follow the format described in [the Aegisub documentation](http://docs.aegisub.org/3.2/Automation/Lua/Subtitle_file_interface/#line-data-tables).
Data lines are similar to info lines, except they additionally have an `id` field containing the original numerical ID of the line in the source file.

Example:

```moon
assfile = parser.parse_file(file)
aegisub.log "The script resolution is #{assfile.script_info_mapping.PlayResX}x#{assfile.script_info_mapping.PlayResY}\n"
```

#### raw_to_line(raw, extradata=nil, format=nil)

Parses a raw line as it appears in the ASS file.

Arguments:

* **raw**: A text representation of the line.
* **extradata**: A mapping from extradata IDs to extradata lines. Corresponds to `ASSFile.extradata`.
If provided, the line will be automatically populated with extradata if extradata IDs are present on the line;
otherwise, the extradata IDs will be silently removed.
* **format**: An ordered list of field names corresponding to the `Format` line at the start of the styles and events sections.
You probably never need to use this.

Returns: A line object corresponding to the given text.

Example:

```moon
>>> json.encode parser.raw_to_line "Dialogue: 5,0:00:04.20,0:00:05.48,Default,,0,0,0,,{\\i1}Starlight."
{"layer":5,"extra":{},"margin_t":0,"margin_l":0,"style":"Default","actor":"","start_time":4200,"end_time":5480,"section":"[Events]","class":"dialogue","margin_r":0,"comment":false,"effect":"","text":"{\\i1}Starlight."}
```

#### line_to_raw(line)

Converts a line object into a text representation corresponding to how it would appear in an ASS file.

Arguments:

* **line**: The line object.

Returns: A raw text representation of the line.

Example:

```moon
>>> parser.line_to_raw {"layer":5,"extra":{},"margin_t":0,"margin_l":0,"style":"Default","actor":"","start_time":4200,"end_time":5480,"section":"[Events]","class":"dialogue","margin_r":0,"comment":false,"effect":"","text":"{\\i1}Starlight."}
Dialogue: 5,0:00:04.20,0:00:05.48,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Starlight.
```

#### create_dialogue_line(fields)

Create a new dialogue line with the given values.
Non-specified values will be populated with default values.

Arguments:

* **fields**: A partial line object, i.e. a map with the fields you wish to specify and their values.

Returns: A new dialogue line object.

Example:

```moon
>>> parser.line_to_raw parser.create_dialogue_line {text: "Hello", style: "Alt"}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:00.00,Alt,,0,0,0,,Hello
```

#### create_style_line(fields)

Like `create_dialogue_line`, but for styles.

Arguments:

* **fields**: A map containing predefined style properties.

Returns: A new style line object.

#### inline_string_encode(input)

## Paste From Pad

Allows you to paste dialogue lines with annotated actors over existing, already-timed lines.
Think of it as a combination of Aegisub's text import and paste lines over (Shift+Ctrl+V) features.

The **Paste over from pad** option allows you to paste text in `Actor: Text` format, after which the contents of the existing lines will be replaced with the pasted text.
All line properties other than `Actor`, `Text` and `Comment` will be left untouched.
If the pasted content contains more lines than exist in the script already, new lines will be inserted, so you can also use this script as a substitute for Aegisub's built-in text import.

Using **Copy to pad** you can do the inverse: The selected lines will be converted to `Actor: Text` format, and can then be copied back to the pad or used for diffing.

```

You can also run Font Validator directly on an ASS file and provide a muxed MKV to read fonts from as an additional argument.
This is useful for making the line numbers more accurate, as comments will be moved to the top of the script when muxing.

```
$ fontvalidator script.ass video.mkv
```

Alternatively, you can provide a list of directories containing fonts, or individual font files.

### Installation

Install Font Validator with pip:

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/NiiTRooX/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts/#subdirectory=scripts/fontvalidator
```

This will add a `fontvalidator` executable along with the `fontvalidator.py` Python module.
If the executable is not in your path, you can run Font Validator as `python -m fontvalidator --help`, or alternatively `py -3 -m fontvalidator --help` on Windows.

### Common issues and how to fix them

#### Missing fonts

```
Could not find font [...] on line(s): [...]
```

In most cases this means you forgot to include a font when muxing.
To solve it, simply include the missing font.

This can also happen if you specified the name of a font incorrectly in a style definition or in an argument to an `\fn` tag.
libass supports using family names and full names for TrueType fonts, and family names and the PostScript name for OpenType fonts.
Use a tool such as `fc-scan` or `Font Info > PS/TTF Names` in FontForge to list the available names for a font, and ensure that you are using a valid name in the script.

#### Missing glyphs

```
Font [...] is missing glyphs [...] on line(s): [...]
```

This happens when you are using characters not supported by the current font.
This will cause the renderer to use a fallback font, or simply fail to render the characters completely.
To solve this, either ensure you are only using supported characters, or switch to another font that does support the characters in question.

#### Faux bold/italic

```
Faux bold used for font [...] (requested weight 700, got 400) on line(s): [...]
Faux italic used for font [...] on line(s): [...]
```

This happens when you have requested a bold or italic font but only a non-bold/non-italic font from the same family is available.
This will cause the renderer to use faux bold/italic, where it emulates bold/italic by simply making the base font thicker/slant.

This is not necessarily an issue, but it is generally preferable to use a true bold/italic font if one is available for the font family in question, as it will generally look better.
Additionally, if you do not mux the true bold/italic font, the result may end up looking slightly different if the user playing the file has it installed.

Another reason you may see this warning is if you are using a very thin font, e.g. one with weight 100.
Since non-bold (`\b0`) corresponds to weight 400 in ASS, the renderer will still apply faux bold even if you did not explicitly request a bold font.
To avoid this, explicitly specify the exact weight of the font you want to use, e.g. `\b100`.

#### Mismatched weight/slant

```
Requested weight 400 but got 700 for font [...] on line(s): [...]
Requested non-italic but got italic for font [...] on line(s): [...]
```

This happens when you requested e.g. a non-bold font, but only a bold version was available.
This generally does not affect the rendering of the font, but if the user has a better-matching font installed, they may end up with a different result.
To avoid this, simply specify the font style explicitly, by including e.g. `\b1` (or `\bX` where X is the weight of the font) for bold fonts or `\i1` for italic fonts.
